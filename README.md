I went through one of the darkest chapter of my life while making this website while i was learning coding. i will always remember how i felt so liberated and strong at the end when i completed making it. I thank my mentor keyur gohil for giving us this project. and major thanks to the creator of this bhagavad gita api. your hardwork is not wasted it will stay here for generations to come and may millions others find this as a source to turn their lives around.
